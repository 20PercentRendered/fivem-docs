By using our official server monetization partner Tebex, server owners are able to monetize their content and communities. They are our *exclusive* provider for server monetization with a competitive commission rate (15%) matching modern commerce services. Tebex offers a wide range of payment methods supporting the most popular Cfx.re server regions and more! With their intuitive dashboard you can launch your own web store within minutes.

Getting started
---------------

In order to use Tebex, you must set up an account on their [website](https://server.tebex.io/register) and go through the steps as outlined on their registration flow.

### Connecting server to Tebex

Using sv_tebexSecret etc.

### Creating your first package

Example tutorial of creating a package that triggers a simple command


Command Variables
---------
There are variables available for use when triggering a command upon purchase of a package. For more information, see [here](https://docs.tebex.io/store/command-management/an-introduction-to-commands#variables-to-customise-your-commands)

| Variable    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `{sid}`      | Net ID of an online player |
| `{hexid}`   | Returns Steam identifier of player |


Advanced Features
----------------

Documentation of commerce natives to create more elaborate systems (e.g. associating an in-game item with a store SKU)

Profit and “ToS” Compliance
--------------------------
Using their platform will count as 'built-in commerce functionality' as described in the FiveM Platform Service Agreement, commonly known in our community as the [Terms of Service](https://fivem.net/terms) 72. So yes, __'profit' is allowed__. We know that many of you have been waiting a long time for a 'legal' and, most importantly, safe way to monetize aspects of your server(s) and we have been listening.

### Limitations
However, we might instill additional terms to disallow purchasing of Rockstar game content (built-in DLC vehicles, etc.) and mandate tracking of earned vs. purchased virtual currency in order to prevent purchased virtual currency from being used to violate any party’s copyright, including Rockstar’s.

Will FiveM run on Xbox or Playstation?
-------------------------------------

No. FiveM is developed exclusively for the PC version of GTA V. There are no plans to support consoles.

Will FiveM run on Linux?
------------------------

The FiveM client cannot run on Linux due to [no support](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/899) for shared resources in DXVK. You can run a FiveM server on Linux.

Where is FiveM installed?
-------------------------

That depends on how you installed it in the first place.

- Did you run FiveM.exe in an empty folder? Then that's where FiveM is installed.
- Otherwise, FiveM installs in `%localappdata%`:
    - Press `WinKey+R` on your keyboard
    - Type `%localappdata%/FiveM` in the dialog that opens
    - Hit Enter
